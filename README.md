# scroll-stopper-instagram
This is a bot that posts intermittently to remind the users to stop scrolling.

# Getting Started
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the script with `python pptwbot.py`

# Work halted due to Instagram not liking bots and the bot returning 429 error always.
